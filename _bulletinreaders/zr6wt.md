### Licenced Since
2020

### How you started
As a child electronics fascinated me. Back then it was valves, and I built many things, starting with a single tube audio amplifier (I think ECL86), test instruments eg VTVM, GDO, and even an oscilloscope using a VCR139a. By age of 16, I was already dabbling in RF transmitters and did transmit illegally then - but just testing and to see how far my signal would go. My dream was to be a licensed radio amateur. But then university and work got in the way, and just never got to it until 2020, when I said enough is enough - write the exam and get my license!

### Most Memorable Contact
Hard to say, lately more JS8CALL than SSB, but with my 5w on JS8CALL, I regularly have QSOs with USA and Australia. With QO-100, my farthest was in Russia.

### Best part of the Hobby
The electronics of it - so I enjoy building, even if it is a kit - but then one still has to wind toroids etc - see my photo of building the WSPR beacon.

### Favorite Modes
JS8CALL
