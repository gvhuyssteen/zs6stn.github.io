### Licenced Since
2009

### How you started
I have always enjoyed electronics, and in particular, communication electronics. 

At a young age, I dabbled with CB radio. In the late 1970’s, I was an apprentice aircraft radio technician  at PLACO, the Piper Aircraft agents. Later, I also worked on military radios like the B25, at Fuchs Electronics. 

This sparked my interest in Ham Radio. My hobbies were cycling, photography and later SCUBA diving, so it was only years later that I took the plunge to write the RAE.

### Most Memorable Contact
There have been many memorable contacts,  some of them on PSK31 when communicating on digital modes using  a keyboard. I enjoy communicating with all Hams, in particular , worldwide contacts “meeting” Hams from different countries.

### Best part of the Hobby
Communicating with people, camaraderie with other Hams and the technical aspects of building electronic projects, antennas etc.

### Favorite Modes
Generally all modes
