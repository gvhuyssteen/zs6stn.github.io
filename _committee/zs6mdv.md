### Licenced Since
2014

### How you started
From my maker days we wanted to send up an autonomous plane with a high altitude weather balloon. 

One of the requirements was we needed some radio contraption called APRS. 

We got in touch with a radio club who assisted us with a APRS beacon. 

After spending time with them and seeing what HAM radio was all about, 4 of us joined the club and got our Ham license.

### Most Memorable Contact
After more than 2 years after having my license I made a HF contact with a station in california with the 40m dipole we made after our RAE, a lead acid battery and 100 watts it blew my mind and I was hooked on HF.

### Best part of the Hobby
Without doubt I am an avid field station operator and QPR'er. I enjoy seeing how far I can get off minimal lightweight gear and the least amount of power possible.

### Favorite Modes
SSB, CW
