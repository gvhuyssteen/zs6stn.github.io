### Licenced Since
-

### How you started
I am a skipper and member for the Four Wheel Drive Club Of South Africa, both these hobbies required radio licenses. 

I am also an avid fan of audiophile quality HIFI so getting a HAM license seemed to be the obvious next step in achieving geek prowess. 

I love the club and over the 5 years I have been an active member and a HAM have made great friends with this common interest.

### Most Memorable Contact
40 meters into South America

### Best part of the Hobby
The constant struggle to understand and learn new things while trying to find the optimal SWR, and letâ€™s not mention the amazing toys and gadgets.

### Favorite Modes
FM, SSB, D-Star

### About Greg 
I am a husband, father, skipper and a wine sommelier with a radio problem. 

I love my country and its people (Especially the Springboks), the great outdoors and a braai. 

I look forward to meeting you on air or around a fire.
