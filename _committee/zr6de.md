### Licenced Since
2018

### How you started
I've been interested in radio for many years. Then ZS6KB convinced me to do the course and the rest is history.

### Most Memorable Contact
Indonesia on 40m - my first DX contact. Unfortunately not confirmed.

### Best part of the Hobby
The variety - there really IS something for everyone.

### Favorite Modes
I enjoy experimenting - satellite, fox hunting, antennas etc

### About Richard 
I love the outdoors, especially hiking and camping when I get the chance. 

I'm more into berg than beach or bush.Since I was a child I've always been interested in design and technology, and anything unusual. 

A few years ago I coached the Lego robotics team that won the national FLL League competition 3 years running. 

I'm also a geocacher and was surprised how many hams are also geocachers. 

So many things to do, and so little time...
