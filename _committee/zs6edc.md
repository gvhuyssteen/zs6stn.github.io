### About Samier 
Iâ€™m Samier, an entrepreneur and property practitioner by day, and an enthusiast for all things gadgets, tech, and guns by night. 

My insatiable curiosity led me to dive deep into the world of amateur radio, and Iâ€™ve discovered that itâ€™s not just a hobby; itâ€™s a versatile skill that can be an essential part of living a prepared and survivor lifestyle.

As an amateur radio operator and the RAE manager for our local Amateur Radio club, Iâ€™m on a mission to share my passion for this fascinating realm with fellow hobbyists. 

I believe that amateur radio can seamlessly blend with my love for gadgets, and Iâ€™m excited to show you how. Join me on this journey as we explore the intersection of technology, communication, and self-reliance. Letâ€™s build a vibrant RAE community and inspire the next generation of radio enthusiasts together.

ðŸ“¡ Stay tuned for tech insights, firearm explorations, and radioÂ adventures!Â ðŸ›°
